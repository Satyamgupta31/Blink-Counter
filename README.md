# BlinkCounter

**BlinkCounter** is a real-time blink detection application built with Python and OpenCV. It uses facial landmark detection to track user blinks and updates a counter with each blink. The project demonstrates the use of computer vision techniques for interactive applications.

## Features
- Real-time blink detection using Python and OpenCV.
- Accurate tracking of eye movements with Dlibâ€™s facial landmark detection.
- Dynamic counter that updates each time a blink is detected.
- Visual feedback with on-screen alerts and counter display.
- Lightweight and responsive, designed to work with a standard webcam.
